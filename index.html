                    It started with the airlines. Well, not exactly; it started with money. Most things do. Outsourcing to India started in the early 1990s,  with back office work, and (finding it incredibly cost-effective), businesses began to outsource "core competencies" (Mullin, 1996), cutting U.S. jobs along the way.
                    Or perhaps I should say that it created Indian jobs along the way. And modern India as we know it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outsourcing isn’t a bad thing; people have been handing off work as long as there was ever work to hand off, and it allows companies to focus on their trade. It can absolutely be a good thing: creating jobs, even liberating oppressed groups (lower castes, women) to some degree. Either way, the changes that are resulting from the IT revolution in both countries are inevitable. In my opinion, they’re positive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Which leads to my (admittedly unique) perspective, as both an interested party in the U.S. and a relative of software engineers and architects in the Indian IT industry. Firstly, from my experience with the Indian side: many people, especially the older generation, are concerned that the increase of modern technology jobs is destroying ancient culture and younger Desis are losing their sense of self.

                    <br>
                    However, though it is true that western culture is being exported at an alarming rate, this process isn’t due to western jobs, but instead may be traced back to India’s colonization and culturally Western ties (widespread English, British “pukka Sahib”).

                    Now to my point about liberation: IT jobs don’t involve manual labor, hence they are deemed more ‘appropriate’ for women to work. “Much of the reason [Indian women] don’t work appears to lie in the persistence of India’s traditional gender norms.” - NYTimes, ‘Why Aren’t India’s Women Working?’. Furthermore, Western employers are less likely to discriminate when hiring. Finally, this demand for IT workers also creates a demand for more skilled labor, influencing work culture, education, and whole cities!

                    Case in point: Bengaluru, the epicenter of the Indian tech industry, dubbed “Electronic City”, and “the Silicon Valley of India”. According to the Times of India, the number of tech workers in Bangalore grew from 1.5 million in 2017 to 4.8 million in 2022. On my trip there (where my uncle works) in 2019 , we saw high-rise apartment blocks being slapped up all over the city, and new public transportation everywhere. The city was filled with businessmen, skilled programmers and engineers, as well as construction workers to fulfill the new demand for infrastructure in the formerly retiree-centered neighborhoods. But we weren't the only ones to notice it; “The quality of jobs is improving amid chronic unemployment” - qz.com.

                    Companies are always looking to cut costs. Continuing to outsource jobs to India fuels the wage disparity in America (because outsourcing jobs only benefits executives, and not employees) and is bad for the American economy. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the other hand, it helps American companies compete in the global economy by keeping prices low, and offers companies an incentive to stay U.S.-based.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same amount of pay (or even less) goes much farther in India than it does in America, so what would be a low-paying second job in America would be a windfall to someone in India. Additionally, there are many companies looking for workers, so it would be relatively easier for Americans to find another job.

                 In conclusion, the rise of IT and technical jobs in India is a great thing for the country. In the U.S., however, it is a necessary evil; in the end, good or bad, greed is human nature, and right now, greed is leading to the outsourcing of U.S. jobs to India. In the grand scheme of things, the IT industry is an overall good, but we can't discount individual sacrifices.
